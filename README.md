# Digial Storage Oscilloscope

This project implements a simple digital storage oscilloscope (DSO) using
[`libsdr`](https://github.com/hmatuschek/libsdr). It uses the sound card as the input source and
implements the basic features of a DSO.

Initially, I needed such a software to record the signals of a simple home-brew [radiation detector](doc/detector.md) I've build. 


## Install
